# MNIST-Digit-Classification
MNIST dataset for handwritten digits from 0 -9 classification model using Deep Learning Neural Networks and Tensorflow library.  
The images are stored 28x28 pixels, trained using sequential model, dense and flatten layer. Sparse categorical crossentropy has been used as 
the loss function, adam is used as the optimizer and the accuracy is calculated using sparse categorical accuracy. The accuracy rate of the model is 97%.
